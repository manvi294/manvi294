Certainly! Here are some points you can consider:

**Why the Induction Programme was Boring and Unstructured:**

1. Lack of Engagement: Perhaps there was minimal interaction or engagement with the participants, leading to a passive learning experience.
  
2. Information Overload: Too much information presented in a short span of time can overwhelm participants and make the session less effective.

3. Poor Presentation: If the content was not presented in an engaging or visually appealing manner, it could contribute to boredom.

4. Lack of Relevance: The content may have lacked relevance to the participants' roles or failed to address their specific needs and concerns.

5. Absence of Practical Sessions: Hands-on activities or real-life scenarios could have been missing, making it harder for participants to apply what they learned.

**Changes Needed:**

1. Interactive Sessions: Incorporate activities, group discussions, and Q&A sessions to encourage participation and engagement.

2. Modular Approach: Break down the content into manageable modules, delivered over a period of time to prevent information overload.

3. Multimedia and Visual Aids: Use multimedia presentations, videos, and other visual aids to make the content more engaging and easier to understand.

4. Customization: Tailor the induction programme to the specific roles and responsibilities of the participants, making it more relevant and impactful.

5. Incorporate Feedback: Regularly gather feedback from participants to identify areas for improvement and make necessary adjustments to the programme.
